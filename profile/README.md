# COEP Quant Finance Club

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the **Quantitative Finance Club at COEP Technological University, Pune, India.**.

We are a student-led, research-oriented community focused on quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and performance-critical financial systems. Our members come from engineering, mathematics, computer science, and data-driven disciplines, united by a shared curiosity for how modern financial markets work at both the **model level** and the **systems level**.

This GitHub organization hosts our technical projects, research experiments, and learning-driven implementations — ranging from quantitative research and data engineering to **low-latency trading systems and high-frequency trading (HFT) concepts**.

## What We Do

Our work spans the full quantitative trading stack, with a strong emphasis on fundamentals, rigor, and hands-on learning:

- **Quantitative Research**  
  Designing and testing trading hypotheses using real market data, statistics, probability, optimization techniques, and machine learning.  
  Focus areas include factor research, market microstructure, regime analysis, and risk modeling.

- **Algorithmic Trading Systems**  
  Building end-to-end algorithmic trading applications — including strategy logic, backtesting engines, portfolio analytics, and execution workflows.

- **Low-Latency Systems & HFT Foundations**  
  Exploring high-frequency trading concepts such as latency optimization, order-flow dynamics, event-driven architectures, and exchange-style system design.  
  Emphasis is placed on understanding *why* low latency matters before optimizing *how* to achieve it.

- **Low-Level & Performance-Oriented Programming**  
  Working with low-level programming languages and systems concepts to understand memory, concurrency, networking, and performance trade-offs in financial systems.

- **Data Engineering for Markets**  
  Designing robust market-data pipelines, handling noisy financial data, and building reproducible research datasets suitable for large-scale analysis.

- **Financial Web & Research Tooling**  
  Developing internal tools, dashboards, and analytics platforms to visualize strategies, research results, and market behavior.

- **Competitive Programming & Algorithmic Thinking**  
  Strengthening problem-solving skills through competitive programming contests and algorithmic challenges that directly translate to quant and systems thinking.

## Our Mission

**Education before execution.**

Our goal is to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world quantitative finance by learning through building. We prioritize strong fundamentals, technical depth, and intellectual honesty over shortcuts or black-box approaches.

We believe progress in quantitative finance comes from collaboration, open discussion, and reproducible work. Learning compounds — but only if you build on solid foundations.


## Networking & Community

The Quant Finance Club at COEP is a platform for motivated students to learn together, challenge each other, and grow technically.

Whether you’re interested in quantitative research, algorithmic trading, HFT systems, or financial engineering, you’ll find peers who value curiosity, rigor, and long-term skill building.

## Open Source & Knowledge Sharing

We actively encourage:

- Open-source projects  
- Transparent and reproducible research  
- Technical documentation and learning resources  
- Peer-to-peer mentorship and collaboration
- However we wish to keep some of our repositories private!
